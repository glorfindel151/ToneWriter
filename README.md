# ToneWriter

ToneWriter is a JavaFX desktop application designed to make it easy to render sheet music for arbitrary chant melodies like those used in Orthodox Christian worship. This type of music is typically unmetered and relatively repetitive, with repeating melodies and long stretches of recitative. These characteristics allow a wide variety of texts to be set to the music, but are unusual in the wider musical world, and thus are not well-supported by conventional WYSIWYG engravers, like Finale and MuseScore. LilyPond gives us the control we need to engrave this kind of music a little more easily, but the task is still laborious and the learning curve is steep.

ToneWriter attempts to solve this problem by abstracting the chant melodies themselves away from the particular text being used, allowing the user to easily define how to map the melody to any given text, and doing all of this in a graphical interface. Users may create their own chant data (commmonly called "tones" in church parlance) or use a tone that comes built into the software. Users then enter the text to be used, which is automatically broken into syllables. Mapping the chant melodies to each line of text is as simple as clicking on the syllable(s) to which each chord will apply. The rest is done completely automatically.
